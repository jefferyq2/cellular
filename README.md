This repo is now superseded by https://github.com/u-blox/ubxlib.

# Introduction
In this repository you will find the implementation of a cellular transport in C for various embedded target platforms, enabling a cellular connection to be used inside the embedded C IoT SDKs of cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure.  The implementation consists of:

- `ctrl`: a driver that allows control of a cellular module over an AT interface, e.g. make connection, read IMEI, read signal strength, etc.
- `sock`: a driver that allows data transfer through a cellular module, presenting the same TCP/UDP sockets API as LWIP and building on top of the AT parser in `ctrl`.
- `port`: the porting layer which allows `ctrl` and `sock` to be compiled and tested on various platforms and within various SDKs; look here for the build files and the tests.
- `cfg`: configuration information for the software in general, specific cellular modules and tests.

# Usage
The C API for `ctrl`, `sock` and `port` can be found in their respective `api` sub-directories and are documented in the header files there.  Information on how to build run tests on a given target platform can be found in the `README.md` files of the relevant platform sub-directory of `port`.

# License
The software in this repository is Apache 2.0 licensed and copyright u-blox with the following exceptions:

- the AT parsing code in `ctrl` is derived from the Apache 2.0 licensed AT parser of mbed-os,
- the heap management code for the STM32 platform (`heap_useNewlib.c`), required because the native ST implementation does not allocate memory correctly when used with FreeRTOS, is copyright Dave Nadler.

In all cases copyright (and our thanks) remain with the original authors.
